This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

P.S. There are lots of errors in the frontend and it does not work well. I had other things that needed my attention so I submitted early 
didn't really implement all the features.
